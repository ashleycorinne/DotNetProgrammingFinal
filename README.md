About
=====
This project is the final project for the .NET programming class.  The project is a Trivia Maze game where the player has to navigate through a maze.  Upon entering a door, the player must then answer a question that is randomly generated from the database.  If you enter answer correctly, you go through the door and head into another room.  This process is repeated again until you manage to find you way out.  

If you get the question wrong, then the player is sent back to the room and the door disappears.  If all three doors have been answered incorrectly then the player is trapped in the room and the game is over.
